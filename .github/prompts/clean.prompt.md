# Purpose
Clean up unnecessary `.js` files and example files in the project root to keep the repo tidy and reduce clutter, while keeping `build.js`.

# Action
Identify all `.js` files and example files in the project root (excluding `build.js`) and remove them safely.

# Result
Project folder only contains relevant files; unnecessary `.js` and example files are removed; easier to maintain and smaller repo size.
